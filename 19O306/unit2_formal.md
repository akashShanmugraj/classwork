# UNIT 2 THEORY OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR

## THE CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR
- Consumer behaviour studies how consumers choose, use, and dispose of products and services, considering emotional, mental, and behavioural responses. It integrates ideas from psychology, biology, chemistry, and economics.

## THE TERM UTILITY
- Utility means 'usefulness' in economics and refers to a commodity's capacity to satisfy human wants.

### Different Types of Utility:
- Form Utility: Change in form or shape of material.
- Place Utility: Transporting goods from one place to another.
- Time Utility: Storing and preserving goods over a period.
- Service Utility: Personal services to the customers.

## Utility School of Thoughts:
1. **Cardinal School of Thoughts:**
   - Utility is measurable. Total utility depends on the quantity consumed.

   | Units of Apples | Total Utility | Marginal Utility |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | 1 | 20 | 20 |
   | 2 | 35 | 15 |
   | 3 | 45 | 10 |
   | 4 | 50 | 5 |
   | 5 | 50 | 0 |
   | 6 | 45 | -5 |
   | 7 | 35 | -10 |

2. **Ordinal School of Thoughts:**
   - Utility is not measurable in numbers but can be ranked by preference.

## INDIFFERENCE CURVE
- An indifference curve is a graph showing combinations of two goods that give the consumer equal satisfaction and utility.

### Assumptions:
- The consumer is rational.
- The consumer purchases two goods, X and Y only.
- The price of a commodity indicates the level of utility derived by him.
- Income, taste, habits, and preferences of the consumer remain constant.

## CONSUMER BUDGET
- A consumer budget is the purchasing potential with which an individual can buy a number of two goods, given their prices.

## THE TERM DEMAND
- Demand is the desire for a commodity backed by willingness and ability to pay the price.

### LAW OF DEMAND
- The amount demanded increases with a fall in price and diminishes with a rise in price.

## DEMAND FORECASTING
- It's the estimation of future demand for a product using methods like survey, statistical analysis, trend projection, and more.

## SUPPLY
- Supply is the ability and willingness to sell or produce goods and services at a particular price.

### Factors Determining Supply
- Number of firms, state of technology, cost of production, prices of related goods, and more.

### Law of Supply
- As the price of a commodity rises, its supply is extended; as the price falls, its supply is contracted.

## MARKET EQUILIBRIUM
- It's a state where supply equals demand, resulting in an equilibrium price.

### Price Ceiling
- A government-imposed upper limit on the price of a good or service.

## CONSUMER SURPLUS
- Consumer surplus is the difference between the price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price they pay for a commodity.
