# Understanding Economics: A Simple Guide

## Unit 2: Theory of Consumer Behaviour

### The Consumer Behaviour

**What is Consumer Behaviour?**
- Consumer behaviour is a big word that means how people choose, use, and get rid of things they buy. It's like when you choose your favorite toys to play with.

**Why is it Important?**
- It helps us understand why people buy certain things and how they feel about them. This helps businesses make better products.

### The Term Utility

**What is Utility?**
- Think of "utility" as how useful something is. If you have a toy that you really like and play with a lot, it has high utility for you.

**Different Types of Utility:**
- There are different ways things can be useful:
  - **Form Utility:** This means changing how something looks or feels, like when wood is turned into a chair.
  - **Place Utility:** It's like when we take toys from one place to another so we can play with them.
  - **Time Utility:** This is when we store things, like food, so we can use them later.
  - **Service Utility:** It's when people do helpful things for us, like teachers teaching us or doctors helping us when we're sick.

### Utility School of Thoughts

**Cardinal School of Thoughts:**
- Some people believe that we can measure how much we like something. It's like saying, "I like this toy a lot!"

**Ordinal School of Thoughts:**
- Others think we can't measure it, but we can say which things we like more than others. It's like saying, "I like this toy more than that one."

### Indifference Curve

**What is an Indifference Curve?**
- Imagine a picture that shows different combinations of toys that make you equally happy. It's like saying, "I'm just as happy with these toys as I am with those toys."

**What Does It Mean?**
- It shows that we have different ways to be happy with our toys, even if we have different combinations of them.

### Consumer Budget

**What is a Consumer Budget?**
- A consumer budget is like having some money and deciding which toys to buy. We can't buy all the toys, so we have to choose the ones we like the most.

### The Term Demand

**What is Demand?**
- Demand is when we really want something and we're able to buy it. It's like when you really want a new toy and you have enough money to get it.

**Law of Demand:**
- This law says that when something costs less, people want more of it. And when it costs more, people want less of it. It's like when your favorite candy costs less, you want more of it!

### Demand Forecasting

**What is Demand Forecasting?**
- It's like guessing how many people will want to buy a certain toy in the future. This helps stores make sure they have enough toys for everyone.

### Supply

**What is Supply?**
- Supply is when people or companies have things they want to sell. It's like when a toy store has lots of toys to sell.

**Factors Determining Supply:**
- Some things affect how much stuff people or companies can sell. Like how many toys they have, how much it costs to make them, and other things.

### Law of Supply

**What Does the Law of Supply Mean?**
- It says that when something costs more, people want to sell more of it. And when it costs less, people want to sell less of it. It's like when a toy store makes more money selling expensive toys.

## Wrapping Up

That's a lot of information about how people buy and sell things! Remember, it's like when you pick your favorite toys to play with, and stores try to have enough toys for everyone. Economics helps us understand all of this! ðŸ›’ðŸŽ®ðŸ“ˆ
